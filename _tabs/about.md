Statistical models are useful tools for testing researchers' hypotheses about psychological phenomena and the relationships between psychological variables, as well as a means of making decisions based on research findings. Statistical models also help us diagnose and assess individuals by measuring psychological attributes and determine whether the items on a test instrument are valid measures of psychological attributes. I am interested in developing and proposing statistical models for researchers and practitioners that are suited to their situation and context so that they can achieve their desired goals. Furthermore, I investigate what methodological and psychometric issues researchers and practitioners may face and how they can be addressed. To this end, I am driven by a strong interest in learning and mastering any relevant knowledge or techniques that can contribute to supporting them effectively.
